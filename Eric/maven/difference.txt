Differences between Maven and Gradle:

1. Configuration:
- Maven uses XML to configure its build
- Gradle uses a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Groovy

2.Flexibility: 
-Gradle is more flexible than Maven
-Allows for more customization of the build process.

3.Performance:
-Gradle is generally faster than Maven due to its incremental build feature, which only rebuilds what has changed since the last build.

4.Dependency management:
-Maven has a central repository of dependencies,
-Gradle allows you to use multiple repositories and even define your own.

5.Learning curve:
-Maven has a steeper learning curve than Gradle due to its XML configuration, while Gradle's DSL is more approachable for developers.
