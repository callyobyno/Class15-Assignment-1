# Differences Between Maven and Gradle

[Based on] --  Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects and Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software.

[Configuration] -- Gradle uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language(DSL) for creating project structure and Maven uses Extensible Markup Language(XML) for creating project structure.

[Focuses] -- Gradle Develops applications by adding new features to them while Maven Develops applications in a given time limit.

[Performance] -- Gradle performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. Maven does not create local temporary files during software creation, and is hence â€“ slower.
