Five Maven and Gradle differnces

1. Build Script Language:
Maven uses an XML-based configuration file(pom.xml)to define the build process,while Cradle uses a Groovy-based or Kotlin-based build script(build.gradle or build.gradle.kts) that allows for more flexiblity and customization.


2.Performance:
Gradle is generally considered to be faster than Maven because it uses a build cache to avoid rebuilding dependencies that haven't changed.In contrast,maven does not have a built-in caching mechanism and relies on incremental builds to speed up the build process.


3.Dependency Management:
Maven has a more rigid approach to dependency management and relies on a central repository to download and manage dependencies. Gradle, onthe other hand, allows for more flexibility and can pull dependencies from multiple sources, including Maven repositories.


4. Plugin Ecosystem:
Maven has a vast plugin ecosystem, with over 1,200 plugins available for various tasks such as code quality analysis, testing, and packaging. Gradle has a smaller plugin ecosystem, but its plugins are typically more powerful and customizable.


5. Ease of Use:
Maven is generally considered to be easier to use for simple projects because it has a more straightforward configuration file format and fewer options to customize the build process. Gradle, on the other hand, can be more challenging to set up and configure but is more flexible and customizable for complex projects.
